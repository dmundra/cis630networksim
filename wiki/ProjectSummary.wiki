=CIS 630 Project Status Summary=

==Project==
Network Simulation

==Description==
Goal of the project is to simulate a network with computers
and routers and messages being send and received between them.

==What we have so far==
We have a hierarchy of interfaces that represent
  * Kernel - Logic responsible for handling routing and messaging
  * Nodes - A machine on the network. May be either a router or a leaf node.
  * Processes - The software loaded into a node.
  * Operating System - The API for the OS to send and receive messages and run processes
  * Simulator - The main control interface to the simulation. From here, nodes are created, destroyed, and manipulated at will.
  
==With that we have classes that represent==
  * Interface Implementations - [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/network/impl/kernel/KernelImpl.java KernelImpl], [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/network/impl/NodeImpl.java NodeImpl], and etc.
  * Protocols - HTTP protocol
  * Software - [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/network/software/HTTPServer.java HTTPServer]
  * Test Programs - [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/CountingTest.java CountingTest], [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/HTTPServerTest.java HTTPServerTest], [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/KernelUserTest.java KernelUserTest]
  
==Test programs we have so far==
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/CountingTest.java CountingTest] - Test two nodes connected to each other where one node sends a number the other one receives it, increments it and sends it back.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/CountingProcessTest.java CoutingProcessTest] - Same as above but uses processes to send and receive messages
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/HTTPServerTest.java HTTPServerTest] - Test of client-server http model
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/test/KernelUserTest.java KernelUserTest] - Test of simple network simulation of routers and computers

==Other Notes==
We are using TestNG to test are code. We have implemented Java Logger in all our classes to use for
logging.

==Next==
  * We are finishing up the [http://code.google.com/p/cis630networksim/source/browse/trunk/src/network/impl/kernel/KernelImpl.java KernelImpl] for routers to manage routing messages sent from one node to another in a network.
  * $$ Do a network simulation that runs the lamport logical clocks algorithm. (Anthony's favorite)
  * $$ Implement another algorithm - voting algorithm, mutex algorithm.
  * Finish report & demo the two examples above $$
